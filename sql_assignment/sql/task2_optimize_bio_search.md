# Task 2: Optimization for searching the bio field for exact matches.

### 1. Change Data Type
We can use a smaller text type: If the biographical information does not exceed a certain length, consider changing bio from LONGTEXT to TEXT or VARCHAR(n). This can save space and impove performance.

### 2. Create a Separate Search Table
Create a separate normalized table specifically for bio entries that would only include the respondent's ID and bio. This allows you to normalize the database, potentially reducing redundancy and improving search performance.

Example:
```sql
CREATE TABLE bio_entries (
    respondent_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    bio VARCHAR(256),
    FOREIGN KEY (respondent_id) REFERENCES evaluations(respondent_id)
);
```

### 3. Implement Full-Text Indexing
This can greatly enhance search capabilities for large text fields. Full-text searches can quickly find matches even within lengthy text fields.

Create Full-Text Index:
```sql
ALTER TABLE evaluations ADD FULLTEXT(bio);
```

Search with MATCH() AGAINST():
```sql
SELECT respondent_id
FROM evaluations
WHERE MATCH(bio) AGAINST('exact phrase to search' IN BOOLEAN MODE);
```

### 4. Use External Search Engines
For more complex searches, we can use a search engine like Elasticsearch or Apache Solr. They are designed for efficient text searching and can handle large datasets better than normal SQL queries.

### 5. Indexing on Exact Match
Create an index for situations where you frequently search for rows based on exact values in a specific column.
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_bio ON evaluations(bio);
```

Running the search:
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM evaluations 
WHERE bio = 'John is a developer.';
```

### 6. Proposed Changes in Table STructure
```sql
CREATE TABLE evaluations (
    respondent_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    department_id UUID,
    name VARCHAR(64),
    bio VARCHAR(256),  -- or use TEXT if longer entries are necessary
    gender BOOLEAN,
    value INTEGER,
    FULLTEXT(bio)  -- Add full-text index if supported by the SQL engine
);
```

or 

```sql
CREATE TABLE evaluations (
    respondent_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    department_id UUID,
    name VARCHAR(64),
    bio LONGTEXT,
    gender BOOLEAN,
    value INTEGER,
    -- Below is not part of the table itself
    INDEX idx_bio (bio)  -- Index on the bio column for exact match searches
);

```
